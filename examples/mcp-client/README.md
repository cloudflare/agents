# Mcp Client demo using Agents

A minimal example showing an `McpAgent` as an MCP Client/Host running in Wrangler.

## Instructions

First, start an MCP server. A simple example can be found in `examples/mcp`, which already has valid binding setup. Set the `MCP_SERVERS` binding variables.

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

You should have the frontend running on http://localhost:5175/. It should list out all the tools, prompts, and resources available.
