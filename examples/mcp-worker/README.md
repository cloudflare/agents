# MCP Worker Example

This example demonstrates how to use `experimental_createMcpHandler` to create an unauthenticated stateless MCP server.

This is THE simplest way to get started with MCP on Cloudflare.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Testing

You can test the MCP server using the MCP Inspector or any MCP client that supports the `streamable-http` transport.
