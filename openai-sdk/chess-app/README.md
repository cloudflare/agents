# Multi-player Chess ChatGPT App

Build a real-time multi-player chess game that runs on ChatGPT by using `McpAgent` to build your ChatGPT app and an `Agent` to be your remote game engine!

The app also shows how you can call ChatGPT from within your app. You can always press the "Ask for help" button and ChatGPT will answer in your conversation with a proper strategy for you.

It had never been easier to play chess with your friends with a tutor by your side!

## Requirements

You'll need a ChatGPT developer account to be able to use ChatGPT apps (connectors). To do so, from ChatGPT go to **Settings -> Apps & Connectors -> Advanced Settings -> Developer mode ON**.
