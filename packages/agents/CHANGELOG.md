  This clears the initial messages cache whenever useAgentChat is unmounted. Additionally, it adds a getInitialMessages option to pass your own custom method for setting initial messages. Setting getInitialMessages:null disables any fetch for initial messages, so that the user can populate initialMessages by themselves if they'd like.

  I also added a chat example to the playground.

  You can now set an initial state for an agent

  ```ts
  type State = {
    counter: number;
    text: string;
    color: string;
  };

  class MyAgent extends Agent<Env, State> {
    initialState = {
      counter: 0,
      text: "",
      color: "#3B82F6",
    };

    doSomething() {
      console.log(this.state); // {counter: 0, text: "", color: "#3B82F6"}, if you haven't set the state yet
    }
  }
  ```

  As before, this gets synced to useAgent, so you can do:

  ```ts
  const [state, setState] = useState<State>();
  const agent = useAgent<State>({
    agent: "my-agent",
    onStateUpdate: (state) => {
      setState(state);
    },
  });
  ```
