# @cloudflare/think

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#1220](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1220) [`31d96cb`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/31d96cb10ab1c8cbd9fd96b73d82ef55c5524138) Thanks [@ghostwriternr](https://github.com/ghostwriternr)! - Fix `@cloudflare/shell` peer dependency to require `>=0.2.0`. Previously, npm could resolve an incompatible shell version, causing runtime errors. If you hit `Workspace` constructor errors, upgrade `@cloudflare/shell` to 0.2.0 or later.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1138](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1138) [`36e2020`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/36e2020d41d3d8a83b65b7e45e5af924b09f82ed) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Drop Zod v3 from peer dependency range — now requires `zod ^4.0.0`. Replace dynamic `import("ai")` with `z.fromJSONSchema()` from Zod 4 for MCP tool schema conversion, removing the `ai` runtime dependency from the agents core. Remove `ensureJsonSchema()`.

## 0.0.2
