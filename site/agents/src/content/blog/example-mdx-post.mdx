import { Logo } from "../../components/logo";

This is a sample blog post written in **MDX**, which allows you to use React components directly in your content!

## Using React Components

You can embed React components like this Cloudflare logo:

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", padding: "2rem" }}>
  <Logo size={100} />
</div>

## Author Profiles in Posts

You can include author profiles in your posts using the `AuthorProfile` component. Note: In MDX files, you'll need to fetch author data in the page component and pass it as props, or use the component directly with author data.

## Code Examples

Here's some example code:

```typescript
import { Agent } from "agents";

const myAgent = new Agent({
  name: "My Agent"
  // ... configuration
});
```

## Benefits of MDX

- **Interactive Content**: Embed React components
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
- **Reusable Components**: Share components across posts
- **Rich Formatting**: All Markdown features plus JSX

## Conclusion

MDX gives you the power of React components within your blog posts, making it perfect for technical documentation and interactive content!
