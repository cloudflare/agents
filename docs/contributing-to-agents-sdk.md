# Contributing to `agents-sdk`

We welcome contributions to the `agents-sdk` project! This document outlines the guidelines for developers who want to contribute.

## Contribution Process

1.  **RFC First:** Before starting significant work, please open an issue as a Request for Comment (RFC) to discuss your proposal. This allows us to iterate together on the design and ensure the changes align with the goals of the `agents-sdk`.
2.  **Fork the Repository:** Fork the `agents-sdk` repository to your GitHub account.
3.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch in your fork for your contribution. Use a descriptive name, such as `feature/new-agent-type` or `fix/typo-in-readme`.
4.  **Implement Your Changes:** Make your changes, following the coding standards outlined below.
5.  **Test Your Changes:** Ensure your changes are well-tested and don't introduce any regressions.
6.  **Submit a Pull Request:** Submit a pull request (PR) from your branch to the `main` branch of the `agents-sdk` repository.

## Coding Standards

- **Code Quality:** Contributions entirely authored by vibe coding (using LLMs without careful review and modification) are unlikely to meet the quality bar and will be rejected. LLMs are powerful tools, but human oversight is crucial.
- **Follow Existing Style:** Adhere to the existing coding style and conventions used in the project. This includes formatting, naming conventions, and code structure.
- **Documentation:** Document your code changes thoroughly. Explain the purpose, usage, and any relevant details of your contribution.
- **Type Safety:** Utilize TypeScript's type system to ensure code correctness and prevent runtime errors.
- **Small Fixes:** Small fixes, type bugs, and documentation improvements can be raised directly as PRs without an RFC.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Descriptive Title:** Use a clear and descriptive title for your pull request.
- **Detailed Description:** Provide a detailed description of the changes included in your pull request. Explain the problem being solved, the approach taken, and any relevant context.
- **References:** Link to the RFC issue (if applicable) and any related issues or discussions.
- **Accept Feedback:** Be willing to accept feedback and make necessary changes to your pull request to align with the goals of the `agents-sdk`. Not every contribution will be accepted, and that's OK.
