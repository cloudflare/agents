_This project is in active development. Join us in shaping the future of intelligent agents._

Welcome to a new paradigm in AI development. Cloudflare Agents provides the foundation for building intelligent, stateful agents that persist, think, and evolve at the edge of the network.

## Vision

We're creating a framework where AI agents can:

- Maintain persistent state and memory
- Engage in real-time communication
- Process and learn from interactions
- Operate autonomously at global scale
- Hibernate when idle, awaken when needed

## Project Status

This project is actively evolving. Current focus areas:

### Ready for Use

- Core agent framework with state management
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- HTTP endpoints and routing
- React integration hooks
- Basic AI chat capabilities

### In Development

- Advanced memory systems
- WebRTC for audio/video
- Email integration
- Evaluation framework
- Enhanced observability
- Self-hosting guide

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

```bash
# Create a new project
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --template agents

# Or add to existing project
npm install @cloudflare/agents
```
